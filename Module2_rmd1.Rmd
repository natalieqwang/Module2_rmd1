## R Markdown

### This is a level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here is a link to [Google](http://google.com)

Here is a word in **bold** and another word in __bold__.

Here is a word in *italics* and another word in _italics_.

When we compile our document, we are using the `rmarkdown` package.

Here are some example R commands:
```
2+2
mean(seq(1,5))
```

Here is an example of non-numbered list:

* Breakfast
    - food
        + eggs
        + toast
        + bacon
    - drink
        + apple juice
* Lunch 
    - taco
* Dinner
    - backed chicken
    - broccoli
    - rice

Here is an example of numbered list: 

1. Breakfast
    a. food
        i. eggs
        ii. toast
        ii. bacon
    b. drink
        i. apple juice
2. Lunch 
    a. taco
3. Dinner
    a. backed chicken
    b. broccoli
    c. rice

Here is an example of blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote
> 2. Second item.

Here is an example of a nested blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> > This text is nested

Here is an example of code in a blockquote (5 spaces after > symbol):

>     2+2
>     mean(c(1,2,3,4))

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, message=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure2, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

## Insert tables
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(cars), 
             caption = "Top 6 Rows of Cars Dataset")
```

## Insert an equation
$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$$


## Insert images

Here is an image inserted:

![sunstar](sunstar.png)

Here is the R logo:

![r logo](https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.svg)

## Insert an animated GIT and video

![sunstar](sunstar/sunstar.gif)

![sunstar](sunstar/sunstar.mp4)

Vebmedr package allows you to insert YouTube videos. 


## Inserting test with some footnotes

Here is footnote reference [^1] and another [^longnote]

Here is an inline footnote ^[Inline notes are easier to write since you dont have to pick an identifier and move down to type the note.]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.
[^longnote]: Here is one with multiple blocks.
